## About
This code is used to display the spatial verification result generated by the place recognition method presented in

We use the public released in https://github.com/tsattler/geometric_burstiness, and save the matching data for display.

## Data
The **Pittsburgh250k dataset** (http://www.ok.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/~torii/project/repttile/) is employed for experiments.
